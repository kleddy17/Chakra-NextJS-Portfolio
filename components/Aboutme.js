I am a full stack software developer that is always striving for my next challenge. Currently, I spend most of my time designing websites, taking courses in different computer science subjects, bartending and participating in the #100DaysOfCode challenge to keep my skills sharp. When I'm not busy coding, you can find me obsessing over DIY projects and video games, or enjoying one of my many hobbies such as hiking or snowboarding.
