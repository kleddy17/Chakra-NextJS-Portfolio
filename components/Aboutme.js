I am a full stack software developer that is always striving for my next challenge. Currently, I spend most of my time designing websites, furthering my educatioin in computer science, and bartending a few nights a week. When I'm not busy coding, you can find me spending time with my family and enjoying hobbies such as baking, snowboarding, and hiking.
